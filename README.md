## What if…

…the game made sure you really wanted to release that Pokémon before it disappeared forever?

## Features

- When releasing a Pokémon that meets any of a given set of criterion, prompt the player to confirm they would really like to release it and suggest why not.
- Quick and easy datapack support for a wide range of possible reasons to match a Pokémon, with the strength of Tim Core behind it!

## Testing

By default, the mod ensures that player would actually like to release a shiny Pokémon. In order to test, give yourself a shiny Pokémon, a non-shiny Pokémon, and a Cobblemon PC. Open the PC, attempt to release the shiny Pokémon, and watch as it asks you with a prompt whether or not you would like to release that Pokémon, as it is shiny.
